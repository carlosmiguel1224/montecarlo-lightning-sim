# ⚡ Monte Carlo Lightning Strike Simulation

This project is a **3D Monte Carlo simulation tool** designed to model lightning strike probabilities across complex structures. It leverages advanced geometry processing and probabilistic algorithms to estimate where lightning is most likely to attach on imported 3D models — particularly useful for infrastructure like launch pads, antenna arrays, or industrial plants.

## 🔍 Overview

The simulation loads a **STEP file** (or other 3D mesh), samples millions of surface points, and performs **thousands of randomized lightning strike simulations** using physical and statistical parameters. The results are then visualized in 3D to show strike density and collision hotspots.

### ✨ Key Features:
- Imports **STEP or mesh files** as simulation geometry
- Runs **Monte Carlo lightning simulations** over sampled surfaces
- Uses **spatial trees** for efficient collision and proximity computation
- Provides **3D visualization** of strike density and impacted areas

## 🧱 Technologies Used
- Python
- `trimesh`, `NumPy`, `Open3D`, `scipy.spatial`
- PyQt5-based 3D viewer (custom)
- Custom KD-tree spatial modeling
- Modular simulation architecture
